## 3rd party libraries

In the project directory, I use the following libraries:

### Bootstrap v5.0.1

Link: [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

I used it to styled the project in a simple and responsive way. 



### Font Awesome v5.15.3

Link: [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) 

Vector icons and social logos. 



### React Router

Library to handle the different routes within the React project. 



### React Modal

Link: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal) 

This is a library that allows the handling of modals. I prefer to use it because it is easy and fast to create modal forms.



### React Redux

Link: [https://react-redux.js.org/](https://react-redux.js.org/) 

I prefer to use React Redux in React projects as it allows easy and clear handling of variables throughout the entire project. 



### Thunk

Link: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) 

In this project itÂ´s not implemented since it does not connect with any database. Allows asynchronous requests. I always use it together with React Redux to have a Backend ready environment.



### Moment

I used this library to handle JavaScript dates. It is easy and has many functionalities.



### Animate.css

Link: [https://animate.style/](https://animate.style/) 

Library for creating CSS animations. I use it since it avoids generating a lot of lines of code.
